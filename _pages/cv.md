Education
======
* B.S. in Physics, Padua University, 2019
  In Padua, I attended Theoretical Physics and Statistical physics courses. The thesis: Fractional Non-Gaussian Brownian diffusion processes, has been realized under the supervision of Flavio Seno (GPA: 110/110)
* M.S. in Complex Systems, Politecnico di Torino, ICTP, Sorbonne Univeristy, 2021
  The main courses I attended during the master's were: Machine Learning, Statistical Physics, Stochastic Processes, Statistical Field Theory, and Information Theory. At the end of the master I worked on my thesis: Time Series Maximally Informative Representation (Under the supervision of Matteo Marsili, Michael Benzaquen, Iacopo Mastromatteo, and Jean Philippe Bouchaud). The thesis was realized in collaboration with CFM Paris. (GPA: 110/110 cum laude)
* Ph.D in Statistics and Computer Science, Bocconi University, 2025 (Expected)
  My research interests lie at the boundary of Machine Learning and Statistical Physics. I mainly focus on Diffusion models, Stochastic Localization, and Compress Sensing and their investigation through replica methods and Approximate Message Passing Algorithms.
