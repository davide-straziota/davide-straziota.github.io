In my first teaching year, I was a teaching assistant for Theoretical Computer Science and Advanced Programming and Optimization courses. The focus Theoretical Computer Science course was on the definition of algorithm computational and allocation complexity, while the Advanced Programming and Optimization course mainly introduced optimization algorithms, like SGD and simplex method.
